# Quick bio
Hi, my name is Nick and for the last couple of years, I write quality documentation for complex technical products.

I am a detail-oriented, driven individual able to work in fast-paced environment, as part of a team or individually.

Good communication with stakeholders (managers, developers, testers) allows me to document new release features and to resolve customer tickets *on time*. 
I have a proven record of working simultaneously in multiple projects, writing and editing technical documents such as:

- User guides
- Administration guides
- Security checklists
- Troubleshooting guides
- Installation guides
- Service guides

I can write using various markup languages and work with different tech stacks. A quick-learner and curious mind by nature, I believe that I can bring value to any team and help to achieve its goals.

In my spare time I do research as a PhD student. I am mostly interested in collecting and analyzing news articles text, to uncover hidden similarity patterns. I can efficiently use Python to perform natural language processing and machine learning tasks, among others.
